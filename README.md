# scraper
A quick web scraper to collect alum contact info and rebuild our directory.  

Python file that scrapes fastpeoplesearch.com to collect address data, then replace spaces with commas and append to a CSV file. 

Next steps: make it only replace spaces after the street address; look for phone and email data; collect phone and email data; test an example that returns multiple results and develop a solution; create a loop that iterates through a list of names and test the scraper on a short list; make a cooler README.
